[![Click here](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Add%20the%20bot-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=discord&logoColor=white)](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=760157065997320192&permissions=8&scope=bot
)

>**Note : You need the corresponding privileges to add the bot on a server.**

## How it works ?



For make a call, a teacher (or any other user with an authorized role): `.Check call @class`
![startcall](img/startcall.png)

Emojis will appear below your message, the students belonging to the `@class` role would be able to click on the âœ… to notify their presence.
The teacher, or anyone with privileges, can end the call by clicking ðŸ†— or cancel with ðŸ›‘.

Note : Users can only notify their presence if they are part of the group (External students will not be counted)
Also, someone who does not have privileges cannot close the call.

Once the call is finished, the bot will return the list of present and missing students and send the list to the teacher in private message.

Every absent student will get an absence notification, like this one :

## Add/Remove privileges from a role

>Only a user with privileges can add/remove roles.
* Add : `.Check add @role1 @role2,...` 
* Remove : `.Check remove @role1 @role2,...`
>Note: You can add / remove as many roles as you want at the same time.

Note that the admin rights will not be checked if no admin has been registered beforehand.

**To see the list of admins,** use command `.Check list` or `.Check roles` (same command)
> Mode quiet : -q

## Change bot prefix
If you want to change bot prefix, use command `prefix` followed by the new prefix. Default prefix is "`.Check `"
## Translation

You can also use the bot in different languages (French,English,German only for the moment)
Use `.Check language fr|en|de`. The language is applied to all the server.
If you want to add another language, please check english json prototype (`language/en.json`) and pull-request your translation!

## Reset the bot

To reset the bot, use command `reset`. Reset command will reset admin list, put default prefix, and set language to english.
>You must be an admin
## Data pravicy

The bot communicates with the server every time you use it. We only keep IDs guilds, roles with privileges, and just during a call, guilds usernames and theirs users IDs.

We also analyse every discord reaction on every servers to see if it correspond to a call message.
